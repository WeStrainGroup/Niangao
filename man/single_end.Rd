\title{Process single-end AB1 files for sequence cleaning.}
\usage{
single_end(file_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{A character string specifying the path to the directory
containing the AB1 files.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item{\code{result_table}}{A data frame summarizing the processing results
for each file, including raw and cleaned sequence lengths, average quality
scores, and deleted base counts.}
\item{\code{fasta_all}}{A character string containing all cleaned sequences
concatenated in FASTA format.}
\item{\code{seq_clean_single_list}}{A list where each element is a cleaned sequence in FASTA format for each corresponding file.}
}
}
\description{
This function takes a directory containing AB1 files, processes them, cleans
the sequences based on quality scores, and provides a summary table and a
concatenated FASTA output, as well as a list of individual FASTA sequences.
